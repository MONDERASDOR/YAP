# YAP (Yet Another Package Manager)

**[Add your library logo or badge here]**

YAP is a Node.js command-line interface (CLI) tool designed as an alternative to popular package managers like npm and Yarn. It offers simple and effective package management commands for installing, updating, removing, and publishing packages, along with user authentication functionality.

## Features

- **Package Installation**: Easily install packages from a registry.
- **Package Update**: Update packages to the latest version.
- **Package Removal**: Remove installed packages from your project.
- **Package Publishing**: Publish your package to the YAP registry.
- **User Authentication**: Register and log in with a username and password for authentication.

## Installation

To install YAP globally on your system:

```bash
npm install -g yap-cli
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

- **Install a package**

  ```bash
  yap install <package-name>
  ```

  Installs the specified package from the configured registry.

- **Update a package**

  ```bash
  yap update <package-name>
  ```

  Updates the specified package to its latest version.

- **Remove a package**

  ```bash
  yap remove <package-name>
  ```

  Removes the specified package from your project.

- **Publish a package**

  ```bash
  yap publish <package-name>
  ```

  Publishes the specified package to the YAP registry. Ensure that you are logged in before using this command.

### Authentication Commands

- **Register a new user**

  ```bash
  yap register <username> <password>
  ```

  Registers a new user with YAP.

- **Login**

  ```bash
  yap login <username> <password>
  ```

  Logs in an existing user for package management operations.

## Configuration (`yap.json`)

The `yap.json` file stores configuration settings for YAP. An example file:

```json
{
  "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org",
  "cacheDirectory": "./cache",
  "auth": {
    "username": "",
    "token": ""
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "info",
    "file": "./logs/yap.log"
  },
  "packageDirectory": "./packages",
  "defaultTimeout": 5000
}
```

### Fields

- **registry**: URL for the package registry.
- **cacheDirectory**: Path for storing cached data.
- **auth**: User authentication information.
- **logging**: Configuration for log levels and output file.
- **packageDirectory**: Path for saving installed packages.
- **defaultTimeout**: Timeout (in milliseconds) for network requests.
